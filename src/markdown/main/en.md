## Hey there!

<br>

Glad to see you on my page!

<br>

My name is Valerii and i'm working as software engineer from 2014.
I was born in Kyrgyzstan in 1989 and lived in Bishkek for 28 years, but then I migrated to Belarus and currently live in Minsk.

<br>

Since childhood I really loved computer games and dreamed of getting into game dev, but my dream turned out to be not as rosy as I imagined it in my youth.
Therefore, I continue to develop software, but decided to return to that, where I started my career in programming.
At the moment I am focused on web development, which, by the way, im not so bad :)

<br>

I also helps people to start their career as software engineers. Mentoring is not my main activity, but rather a hobby that helps to learn by yourself and meet new people. It's always funny.

If you have any interesting ideas for cooperation/startup or just want to chat with me - feel free to connect. You can find my social networks somewhere on this site, just look around.
